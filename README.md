# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
Brief : Creating an entertainment game for children aged 7-12 years old.The game aims for the user to place 3 identical pieces in a consecutive sequence of positions before his opponent.   

People : 
<ul>
<li>Age :7-12 years old</li>
<li>Full range of weights and heights </li>
<li>Novice user </li>
<li>Without special needs</li>
<li>Heterogeneous mix due to diversity of individuals in terms of body and character characteristics , with homogeneity in age range and school tenure. </li>
<li>Discreet users use it at times in play and interaction situations with another person.</li>
<li>Infrequent users , as it is a game and not a daily need of individuals.</li>
</ul>

Activity :  
<ul>
<li>Rare use</li>
<li>Relaxation game with short duration (1- 5 minutes) as it is a game without any particular difficulty to achieve the goal</li>
<li>Functional difficulty level : Easy </li>
<li>Continuous</li>
<li>2 opposing players (no cooperation)</li>
<li>Simple command process</li>
<li>Response time : directly </li>
<li>Safe design for children - Not safety critical as children are of an age where there is an early maturation without the risk of swallowing a piece.</li>
<li>Serial task - no other activities are included in parallel </li>
<li>Active - users act on the continuation of the </li>
<li>Quantity > Quality </li>
<li>Input requirements: touch</li>
<li>There will not appear error signs.</li>
</ul>

Context :
<ul>
<li>Organisational: Does not affect individuals organizationally</li>
<li>Physical: internally - because of the technology used </li>
<li>Social environment: operation part the house</li>
<li>Circumstance: Employment of play in entertainment or relaxation situations at home.</li>
<li>New knowledge: Understanding of game play by the people playing it.</li>
</ul>

Technology : 
<ul>
<li>Input : Select commands by touch. </li>
<li>Output: Colour-changing lights</li>
<li>Communication : There is no communication between devices.</li>
<li>Content: Understanding two shapes and success through the continuous series of three times of the same shape.</li>
<li>Τεχνολογίες: Light sensor , touch sensor , without network function.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
Step 3)
<li>Context : Entertainment of users , game for two </li>

<li>Content : Game for two , data types: constraint X kai O , Constraint Player 1 kai Player 2 . Exit Play again after full fill </li>

<li>Users: Tasks: Each user alternately places the X/O in one of the 9 positions on the board. The aim is to create a sequential triad of X/Os.</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
Step 4)
<li>In our artifact which is a trilithium , in our case the user will move specific blocks onto the light sensors that will essentially replace the O's and X's in the order the user wants so as to form the row of three identical symbols. It possibly resembles the physical way in which the tic-tac-toe game is played. Still, there will be a small screen where it will be indicated which player is playing at any given time.</li>
